## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first-time using rem units. I found it easy to make the HTML base font size 62.5% for simpler calculations.

I figured out for the picture element that if I’m coding mobile-first, the source element for the largest screen size should appear first, otherwise the browser will select the photo meant for the smallest screen size every time regardless of the viewer’s screen size.

This is a contrast to adding media queries in the CSS where coding mobile-first means that you begin with the smallest screen size and work your towards the largest screen size.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
  <picture>
        <source srcset="images/image-header-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)">
        <source srcset="images/image-header-mobile.jpg" media="(min-width: 327px)">
        <img class="hero-img" src="images/image-header-mobile.jpg" alt="Women sitting at a table chatting and typing on laptops.">
   </picture>
```

### Continued development

My plans for continued development improvements include mastering responsive images, stronger HTML markup, and accessibility.
